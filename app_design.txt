**Additional Folders (Explanation):**

├── inherit/
│   │   **Explanation:** This folder likely contains code for inheriting existing models or views to customize or extend their functionality. Odoo supports two main inheritance approaches:
│   │       - **model inherit** (traditional.inherit, delegations.inherit):
│   │           - Allows you to inherit from existing models and potentially customize their fields, methods, or behavior.
│   │           - `traditional.inherit` inherits all fields and methods from the parent model.
│   │           - `delegations.inherit` inherits only specific fields from the parent model.
│   │   - **views inherit**:
│   │       - Allows you to inherit from existing views and modify their structure or behavior.

**Window Actions (ir.actions.act_window):**

- **Description:** These actions open windows within the Odoo interface.
- **Use Cases:**
    - Opening forms for creating or editing records.
    - Displaying list views of records.
    - Opening wizard windows for specific tasks.

**Server Actions (ir.actions.server):**

- **Description:** These actions are executed on the Odoo server and can perform various tasks.
- **Use Cases:**
    - Modifying existing records.
    - Creating new records.
    - Executing Python code to implement complex business logic.
    - Triggering workflow transitions.
    - Performing batch operations on records.

**Automated Actions (ir.cron):**

- **Description:** These actions are scheduled to run automatically at specific intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Use Cases:**
    - Background tasks.
    - Scheduled reports generation.
    - Data synchronization.

**Report Actions (ir.actions.report):**

- **Description:** These actions generate and display reports.
- **Use Cases:**
    - Generating PDF or HTML reports.
    - Printing labels.
    - Exporting data to Excel.

**URL Actions (ir.actions.act_url):**

- **Description:** These actions open external URLs in a new browser tab or window.
- **Use Cases:**
    - Opening external websites.
    - Accessing external documents.
    - Redirecting users to other applications.

**Client Actions (ir.actions.client):**

- **Description:** These actions are executed on the client-side (in the user's browser).
- **Use Cases:**
    - Triggering JavaScript events.
    - Opening dialogs or notifications.
    - Updating the user interface without server interaction.
    - Implementing custom JavaScript logic for UI enhancements.
